ccLookup
0.8.7 
21 October 2004

ccLookup is a tool for confirming the license claim embedded in digital 
audio files matches the license claim published on the web.  ccLookup 
currently supports MP3 files.

ccLookup may be run from the distribution directory.  Alternatively, the
.so support files may be placed anywhere on the system path.  The 
executable, lookup, and user interface definition, lookup.xrc, must remain
in the same directory.

Linux builds are still somewhat experimental; please report any problems
or suggestions to the author, Nathan Yergler <nathan@creativecommons.org>.
